    ### Rustup is an official Rust project that allows us to install, manage, and update multiple Rust toolchains. It can be installed easily via:
    $ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
    source $HOME/.cargo/env

    ### Check cargo and rustc to confirm that we have Rust and Cargo installed
    $ cargo
    $ rustc
    ### Run rust snippets easily
    $ cargo install rust-script

    ### Next it's advisable to install the Rust source and documentation locally for later use when offline or for tools such as the autocompletion
    $ rustup component add rust-src
    $ rustup component add rust-docs
