# LinuxMint-XFCE

## Mail-client: evolution

### Setting: open link in firefox/chrome

```sh
    # Check the config, sure it's not xfce's config, because evolution not know the xfce at all.
    $ gvfs-mime --query x-scheme-handler/http
    $ gvfs-mime --query x-scheme-handler/https

        Default application for 'x-scheme-handler/http': firefox.desktop
        Registered applications:
                firefox.desktop
                google-chrome.desktop
                opera.desktop
        Recommended applications:
                firefox.desktop
                google-chrome.desktop
                opera.desktop

    # Set it to chrome
    $ gvfs-mime --set x-scheme-handler/http google-chrome.desktop
    $ gvfs-mime --set x-scheme-handler/https google-chrome.desktop
```

### Viewing Unread messages from task-bar windows title

1. Right Click on "Search Folders", and create a new folder, for example named as 'vfolder':
 - in vfolder properties
 - in "rules", make a rule that says "Status" "is not" "read"
 - in "search folder sources" choose specific folders, or the all folders option.
   You can also choose "all related" threads to get replies and parents to an unread message in the same vfolder.

Now view this folder instead of your inbox, and you will only see unread messages!

2. Compare with another method: You can also choose View -> Hide Read Messages to accomplish this > task.

The 'vfolder' isn't as simple as just showing unread messages.  I actually have the following in my vfolder rules:

 - "Date sent" "is after" "2 days ago" or 
 - "Status" "is not" "Read" or 
 - "Label" "is" "Important" 

This shortens my inbox with ~800 messages down to less than 20!
I also have "Include threads - all related", so that I get replies and 
originals that fall outside of the above criteria. 

It's great!  Evolution is the only mail reader I know that lets you do 
so much with vfolders.  Even thunderbird's search folders can't do as 
well as this!
