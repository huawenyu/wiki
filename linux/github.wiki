# Multiple public keys for one user

You can have as many keys as you desire.  It's good practice to use separate private/public key sets for different realms anyway, like one set for your personal use, one for your work, etc.

First, generate two separate keypairs, one for home and one for work:

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.home
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.work

Next, add an entry to your `~/.ssh/config` file to pick the key to use based on the server you connect to:

    Host home
    Hostname home.example.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.home
    User <your-home-acct>

    Host work
    Hostname work.example.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.work
    User <your-work-acct>

Next, append the contents of your `id_rsa.work.pub` into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the work machine, and do the same for the home key on your home machine.

Then when you connect to the home server you use one of the keys, and the work server you use another.

Note you probably want to add both keys to your `ssh-agent` so you don't have to type your passphrase all the time.
