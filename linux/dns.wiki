# DNS cache

https://www.keycdn.com/support/dns-cache

DNS cache is a very efficient way to avoid having to complete an entire DNS lookup each time you visit a site.
Instead, this process will only need to occur the first time you visit the site and upon subsequent requests,
    your machine will use the OS's and browser's cached DNS information until it expires or is flushed.

## OS-level

- Linux have no OS-level DNS caching
- Windows have OS-level DSN cache: ipconfig /displaydns
- Mac have cache

## Browser level

- Chrome:
    Input "chrome://net-internals/#dns" into your address bar,
    The browser will list current list of cached DNS records.
