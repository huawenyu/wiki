By default, Makefile targets are "file targets" - they are used to build files from other
files. Make assumes its target is a file, and this makes writing Makefiles relatively easy:

    foo: bar
      create_one_from_the_other foo bar

However, sometimes you want your Makefile to run commands that do not represent physical files
in the file system. Good examples for this are the common targets "clean" and "all". Chances
are this isn't the case, but you *may* potentially have a file named ``clean`` in your main
directory. In such a case Make will be confused because by default the ``clean`` target would
be associated with this file and Make will only run it when the file doesn't appear to be
up-to-date with regards to its dependencies.

These special targets are called *phony* and you can explicitly tell Make they're not associated with files, e.g.:

    .PHONY: clean
    clean:
      rm -rf *.o

Now `make clean` will run as expected even if you do have a file named `clean`.

In terms of Make, a phony target is simply a target that is always out-of-date, so whenever
you ask `make <phony_target>`, it will run, independent from the state of the file system. Some
common `make` targets that are often phony are: `all`, `install`, `clean`, `distclean`, `TAGS`,
`info`, `check`.
