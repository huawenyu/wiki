# Firefox ignore invalid ssl-certificates

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20088/is-there-a-way-to-make-firefox-ignore-invalid-ssl-certificates

I ran into this issue when trying to get to one of my companies intranet sites. Here is the solution I used:

 - enter about:config into the firefox address bar and agree to continue.
 - search for the preference named security.ssl.enable_ocsp_stapling.
 - double-click this item to change its value to false.

This will lower your security as you will be able to view sites with invalid certs. Firefox
will still prompt you that the cert is invalid and you have the choice to proceed forward,
so it was worth the risk for me.
